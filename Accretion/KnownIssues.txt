Level specific issues


Realism issues
(high) MutualGravitation ruleset will double count two gravitating objects against each other, doubling their pull on each other.
(medium) There is some issue where little masses, initially at rest, being pulled in by gravity and crasing into a sun will push the sun away. There really should be net zero movement in the system after absorption I think.

Gameplay issues
(high) Ejection speed should probably increase as you get bigger. Otherwise it gets increasingly boring to traverse long distances
(low) Improve the mouse direction pointer. It's not very pretty, doesn't scale great when you zoom, and isn't obvious to use.
(medium) check all spellin' plz

Features
Somehow mark off levels that have been beaten
instead of culling distant objects, don't include them in the collision detection partitions?

Performance issues
(medium) My collision detection has nice "average case" execution time, but not great "worst case" execution time. And "worst case" is probably more important in a game.
(super low) Don't redraw the mouse direction pointer so often
(medium) Make the collision skip a configurable setting, or auto-detect it based on CPU usage
